# Rule of Parsimony

**Developers should avoid writing big programs.** This rule aims to prevent overinvestment of development time in failed or suboptimal approaches caused by the owners of the programâ€™s reluctance to throw away visibly large pieces of work. Smaller programs are not only easier to optimize and maintain; *they are easier to delete when deprecated*.

Not Parsimounious (i.e. small):

* RVM
* OmniAuth
* Windows
* Rails
