# Rule of Clarity

Developers should write programs as if the most important communication is to the developers, including him- or herself, whom will read and maintain the program rather than the computer.

This rule aims to make code readable and comprehensible for whomever works on the code in future.

# Rule of Transparency

Developers should design for visibility and discoverability by writing in a way that their thought process can lucidly be seen by future developers working on the project and using input and output formats that make it easy to identify valid input and correct output. This rule aims to reduce debugging time and extend the lifespan of programs.

Key word: communication - to who? The *developer*, not the computer

* Good naming - many comments can be made redundant with good names
* Commentary around complex or confusing computations
* Whitespace to separate different concepts and ideas
* Consistent Formatting
* Well written README files
* Well written documentation

Literate programming can greatly increase transparency of your thought process.

Opaque & Unclear:

* Functions that do work at different levels of abstraction
* Variable and functions names like `a`
* Crazy levels of nesting - "jagged left edge"
